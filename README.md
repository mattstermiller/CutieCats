# Cutie Cats
This will be a simple game about cats piloting spaceships battling an evil mouse. It is the brainchild of my daughter Natalie. 

Characters Cutie Cat, Koala Cat and Famous Cat each have unique spaceships with deflector shields to fend off fireball attacks from the wily Meanie Mouse.

It is written in F# utilizing the MonoGame framework.
